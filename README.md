# Unique-Password-Generator
A password generator is a tool that creates unique passwords by randomly combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Password generators use algorithms to create random passwords based on a combination of characters, numbers, and symbols. 
Password generators can help users create strong passwords that provide greater security for a given type of access. They ensure that passwords are difficult to guess and enhance online security. 
Password generators allow you to create different passwords for different websites so that if one gets compromised the others remain safe. 
Some password generators include: 1Password, Dashlane, NordPass, LastPass, Bitwarden. 
Password managers typically include built-in password generators so you can create a secure password on the fly when signing up for a new account.
